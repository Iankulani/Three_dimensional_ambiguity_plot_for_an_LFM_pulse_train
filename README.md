# Three_dimensional_ambiguity_plot_for_an_LFM_pulse_train
This repository provides an implementation to generate a three-dimensional ambiguity plot for a Linear Frequency Modulated (LFM) pulse train. The ambiguity function helps analyze the time-frequency characteristics of the signal, offering insight into resolution and detection performance.
